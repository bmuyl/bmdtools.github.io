MetaOptimalPath is our optimal control tool.

It is our tool for finding optimum trajectories of boat control parameters (rudder angle, main sail sheet... ) along manoeuvers ( tacks, gibes, Take off..) or dynamic event like crossing a gust or a lul. It is also used for comparing the potential performance of various boat designs on courses.

Although we use it for boat design in our daily work, it is actually agnostic on the type of mobile it's dealing with.
Motor boats, sailing boats, Flying Drones, submarines, planes.. can all be adressed with MetaOptimalPath.

Some of the major features:
- mobile agnostic
- force model based
- convergence based on automatic differentiation
- solving based on XXXXX



MetaOptimalPath's development started in 2019.
