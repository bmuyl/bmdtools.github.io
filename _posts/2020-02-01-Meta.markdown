Meta is our Velocity Prediction Program (VPP).

It is our tool for finding optimum static equilibriums.
Although we use it for boat design in our daily work, it is actually agnostic on the type of mobile it's dealing with.
Motor boats, sailing boats, Flying Drones, submarines, planes.. can all be adressed with Meta.

Some of the major features:
- mobile agnostic
- force model based
- able to account for structural deformations


Meta's development started in 2013 in a collaborative project involving Guillaume Verdier and Groupama Sailing team.
It has since gone through several improvements and rewriting, such that is nothing left fro the original versoin.
It's now in a stable state.
